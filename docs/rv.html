			<p>This project is purely hypothetical right now, that is to say, it exists mostly in my head, but I hope to let you in one day.</p>
			<p>As I say in the <a href="about.html">about</a> page, my heroes in this area are Tame Impala, Alt-J, Jimi Hendrix, and The Black Keys. Now that I think about it, I would absolutely add Sufjan Stevens' albums <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGStUxiLGM">"The Age of Adz"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dYi4P0xNkE">"The Ascension"</a> to that list, although I truly don't understand how he makes the noises he does.</p>
			<p>I don't have anything recorded for this project yet, and the name probably isn't going to stick, but I can give you a brief preview over text. Think guitars like WAH-WAH-WAH and synths going shwoooooo shwoo bwah bwah and then the drums come in like CRASH BOOM CHICK TISS BA-BOOM-BOOM CHICK TISS and the bass is in there somewhere too and it kinda sounds like an airplane is landing and then these vocals come in that sound like some guy is standing on the other end of an airplane hanger and singing something about time passing and flying and how they don't know now but ooh they'll see one day and a bunch of other stuff you can't understand. Get the picture? Do I even need to make the songs or can I just have a Grammy?</p>

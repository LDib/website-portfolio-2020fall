			<p>Hello! My name is Lucas Nicolo DiBlasi, and I go by the moniker Nicolo as an artist. I primarily make music in two genres: indie-folk and indie/psychedelic rock. I suppose I could just say indie or alternative music, but I like to keep the two separate in my head, because they feel like such different worlds. Sometimes, on a crisp autumn day, I want an acoustic guitar and soaring harmonies, like Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes, or Simon and Garfunkel. Of course, summer works just as well for a fine folk song, like the warm embrace of Iron and Wine's music, or some of John Mayer's more down-to-earth albums.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, though, even the strongest strums of an acoustic guitar aren't nearly enough. Sometimes, I need a heavily overdriven guitar (or three), synthesizers, a Hofner bass, blown-out drums (originally being a drummer myself), and wavey vocals, all dripping with reverb and saturation. I turn to these songs for specific moods and themes that can't quite be captured in words: isolation, fear, pride, exaltation, rage, the passage of time, Absurdity, profundity. My idols in this arena are Tame Impala, Alt-J, Jimi Hendrix, and The Black Keys.</p>
			<p>I haven't actually created much yet, it's all a work in progress, but I'll start sharing as soon as I possibly can. Stay tuned.</p>

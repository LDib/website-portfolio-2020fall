			<p>I've been drawn to the acoustic guitar and storytelling-driven songwriting ever since I started paying attention. It's nothing special, it's nothing I think is going to change the world, it may not even be good, but I'm in the process of writing my first EP in this style. I thought I might as well stop half-writing songs and start whole-writing songs. The first one is finished and you can find it back on the homepage. It's called Blues and Greens and I'm just glad it's done (it's on the homepage). The rest will be on their way soon enough. Oh, yeah: the EP revolves around nostalgia, and memories of a home you can't return to, and it suddenly became so caught up with colorful motifs that I thought I'd call it "Colors," but that's not that creative so maybe I'll find something else to call it by the time it's done. If you have the time, too, go check out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRCA_Fo0rWA"> much better song</a> by the same name. </p>

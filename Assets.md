Assets

Assets I need:
-whatever images are need for twitter/facebook/instagram buttons
-a background gif for the mp3-box div
-To find and put into this folder a copy of Blue and Greens (as an mp3)(and then link it)
-images for the colors and rv boxes background. Actually, maybe not, but images for them might be good. Maybe use GIMP?

Trees2 is a photo by Filip Zrnzevic on Unsplash (I don't need to attribute it, but the alt text with attribution is in there under aria-label, that's one way to do alt text for a background image)

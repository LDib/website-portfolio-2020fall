A brief overview of my final project goals:

Essentially I'd like to do two broad things.

1. I'd like to level up my website so it looks professional and functions a little better according to accepted rules
	- Using semantic HTML better
	- Using a specifically selected web font
	- Using better and more intentionally selected colors and images that correlate to the EP I'm coming out with
	- Miscellaneous styling things I didn't get around to (mostly links)
	- Possibly also liner note kind of things with good paragraph styling
2. I'd like to create one or more images in GIMP that I can use on the website
	- All of my experience with GIMP came from earlier this semester, so I don't expect to do more than one, or even for the one to look fantastic, but I'd like to give it the old college try and create something that is my own that I can add to the site

I think this overview also functions really well as a task list, and I can start to tackle it in pretty much any order I want to.
